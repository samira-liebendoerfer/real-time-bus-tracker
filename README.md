# Real Time Bus Tracker

### Project Description

This exercise was all about adding animation to a map. An API (MBTA bus data) is being used to determine bus stops between Harvard and MIT. The API of Google Maps is bein used to display a map. An animated marker is added on the map to highlight the bus routes.


### How to Run

You can download or fork this repository. To see the bus marker moving in real time open the index.html file in a browser of your choice. 
If you want to use the code you can edit it in a code editor. 
The file structure is the following: 
- index.html
- mapanimation.js
- styles.css
- blue.png
- red.png

### Roadmap
- add time and date
- add the bus schedule
